# Car & Pedestrian Tracking Algorithm

#### using Python🐍 and OpenCV

###### Working Principal

In the working of this algorithm, we use what's called **Haar Features** which are boxes like this,Computer Vision provides the algorithm with real time data that is converted into grayscale for better accuracy. The trained data is capable of superimposing these blocks on the objects infront of it, if they superimpose, it declares them as cars, The same logic is applied for recognizing pedestrians.

##### An Example of how **Haar Features** look

###### This isn't much accurate but it's an awesome way to start your journey into the awesome world of AI & ML!
