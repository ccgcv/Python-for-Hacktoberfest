# Twitter Scaper using Twitter API 
## Extracting Tweets containing a particular Hashtag

1) First of all you need to have a Twitter Developer account to get started with this tool. A Twitter Developer account will get you access to Twitter APIs and Tools. It's easy to get acces to this, usually takes 3-4 hours. Click [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) to get your own dev account.
2) Enter all the access tokens and api keys in the config file. Mention the hashtags you want to include. Increase the count of tweets you want to extract.
3) Open the terminal and head to the directory where both files are stored.
4) Compile using 
  
    `>python3 config.py`
    
    `>python3 main.py`

5) Wait for a few seconds or minutes (based on your internet speed or count of tweets you are going to extract).
6) Your extracted tweets and extracted user data will appear in a `.csv` file in the same directory.

Happy Coding :)
